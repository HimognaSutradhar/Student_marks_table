# LaTeX Table with Student Marks

This project contains a simple LaTeX document that generates a table of student marks. The table consists of four main columns: `S.No`, `USN`, `Student Name`, and `Marks` for three subjects.

## Files

- `main.tex`: The LaTeX file that contains the table with proper formatting.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the structure and usage of the LaTeX document.

### LaTeX Features

- **Multirow**: Used for `S.No`, `USN`, and `Student Name` labels.
- **Multicolumn**: Used for the merged header `Marks` covering three subject columns.

To compile the LaTeX document, follow these steps:

1. Use a LaTeX editor (e.g., [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or TeXShop).
2. Compile the `main.tex` file using a LaTeX engine like `pdflatex` or `xelatex`.
